# EXPERIENCE
# schema explanation follows, but it's not enforced by anything. Would be a fun make step though!
# 
#   {
#     employer: required
#     job: job title, required
#     startDate: YYYY-MM(-DD::etc) Y&M are required
#     endDate: optional & same as startDate. If blank, present is inserted by template
#     city: optional
#     roles: required, a list of roles (see object below)
#       [{
#         role: required subtitle or project name or event etc etc. More specific than job title
#         time: optional time spent in role, written however
#         bullets: optional but would be weird to leave out
#       }]
#   }
#  The whole subrole array thing is odd 
#  but I need it due to having a few sub-roles (consultancy, wahey)
